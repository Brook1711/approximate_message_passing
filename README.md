# Approximate Message Passing(AMP) for LASSO
A Python implementation of Approximate Message Passing (AMP) algorithms for LASSO

These algorithms are implemented based on the following papers 
* [Message-passing algorithms for compressed sensing
](https://www.pnas.org/content/106/45/18914.short)
* [Vector approximate message passing](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8006797)
    - and its [longer version](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03082)
